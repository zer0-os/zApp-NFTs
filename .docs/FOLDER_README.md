_This file should be copied to the root of any folder directly in `src/` (i.e. `src/components`, but not `src/components/Button`) and renamed to `FOLDER_NAME_README.MD`. The point of this file is to clearly explain the purpose of any part of our code base, and improve self-documentation. This will be important for consistency across our dapps. Please fill out anything in square-brackets below. Make sure to use clear English, as there will be people using these files that aren't English-native speakers._
